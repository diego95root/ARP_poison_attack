# ARP_poison_attack
Script written in Python designed to ARP poison other devices on the same network.

When run, it displays a list of available ips to poison, as well as some general info:

Than, we have three options, refresh available ips, poison a certain device / poison all or restore all connections. Once we exit the program with ctr + c all connections are restored to their original state.
